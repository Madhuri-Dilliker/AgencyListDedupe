# Purpose 
Dedupe Resource Lists for Covid and resource directory.

The plan is to first dedupe the Organization names and create an Org ID. Then use Org ID and Program name to dedupe programs.



# Prework

Ran both lists of data "Master-Agency-Finder" and "ResourcesCovid" though OpenRefine and clustered the org names.
